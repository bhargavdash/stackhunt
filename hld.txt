# Open Source Issue Tracker - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** OSS Issue Tracker  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 2025  
**Product Owner:** [Your Name]

## Executive Summary

The Open Source Issue Tracker is a web application designed to help developers discover and track relevant open source contribution opportunities. Instead of manually checking GitHub repositories, users receive proactive email notifications when new issues are opened in their areas of technical interest.

## Problem Statement

Developers interested in open source contributions face several challenges:
- Time-consuming manual monitoring of multiple repositories
- Difficulty discovering relevant issues matching their skillset
- Missing opportunities due to irregular checking
- Lack of centralized tracking for contribution opportunities

## Solution Overview

A web application that automates the discovery and notification process for open source issues based on user's technical interests and preferences.
