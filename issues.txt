1. When new user logs in it shows "Welcome back", but it should show "Welcome". For the user whom we already have 
technologies preference in our db, we can show "Welcome back" and load there dashboard.
2. Initial dashboard before onboarding needs improvement, it still shows the previous strategy of connecting to
github. Also this 3 column plan does not look good. 
3. After completing onboarding, it still shows "Github Connected" in the dashboard, and a "Connect to github"
button is also present below the navbar.
4. The flow should be whenever user completes the onboarding or edits the present technologies, we should 
get the issues and repos from github through our backend and show them. 
5. While we fetch from github, we can redirect the user to dashboard and show them a loader, which says 
"Fetching from github.. " or something like that (replace if you know anything better).
6. Also, this 2 column approach in the dashboard looks ugly. Think like a UI/UX designer and build me a beautiful
looking UI consisting of -> 
6.1 The major part of dashboard will show the issues from github and other metadata. 
6.2 There will also be a section/page/sidebar or something for the user to edit its technologies.
